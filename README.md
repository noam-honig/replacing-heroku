# replacing-heroku
A list of Heroku replacements, now that Heroku announced that they no longer provide a free tier

## My take on things
1. render - [Only one free db and will be deleted after 90 days](https://render.com/docs/free#free-postgresql-databases)


# Node & Postgres
1. fly.io

# node js:
1. https://railway.app/ - explore
2. Vercel.
3. https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/node-elastic-beanstalk/?fbclid=IwAR2xibyOEO_AtqdG482kE0B2h09eXJNRpsEV2xYM8wr6lCePJtixqrEZqUk

# Fullstack
1. https://render.com/render-vs-heroku-comparison (database are deleted after 90 days of inactivity?)
1. https://www.deta.sh/
2. fly.io
2. https://domcloud.co/docs/deploying/node
2. https://adaptable.io/pricing
2. https://www.koyeb.com/pricing
2. https://qoddi.com/postgresql/
3. DigitalOcean App Platform


# Server less
1. https://www.cyclic.sh/ -‚≠ê - has good free tier - supports dynamo db - looks nice
2. Netlify, very short serverless functions
3. Cloudflare - seems partial support for serverless functions
4. Firebase - https://towardsdev.com/host-a-nodejs-app-with-firebase-87c771489bea


## Postgres:
1. ElephantSQL
2. supabase.com

## Other:
https://caprover.com/ - creates a docker and deploys it to gidital ocean or anything else
