# replacing-heroku
A list of Heroku replacements, now that Heroku announced that they no longer provide a free tier

# Node server + Postgres Database
1. railway.app üëç - easiest to install, great dev experience - only hosted on westcoast so slow to Israel (200ms latency) :(
2. fly.io üëç - installs via cli, docs is pretty technical and scary - but it works - followed this article:
   * https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/node/
   * 120ms latency
3. render - [Only one free db and will be deleted after 90 days](https://render.com/docs/free#free-postgresql-databases)
   1. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-nodejs-application-with-render/
   2. have project on github
   3. create project type "Web Service" and connect to github
   4. create new postgres database (as opposed to heroku - the database is separate from the website)
   5. currently failed to deploy - doesn't show why :( üòí
