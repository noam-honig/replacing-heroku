# replacing-heroku
A list of Heroku replacements, now that Heroku announced that they no longer provide a free tier

# Node server + Postgres Database
1. railway.app üëç - easiest to install, great dev experience - only hosted on westcoast so slow to Israel (200ms latency) :(
   1. https://blog.railway.app/p/automated-postgresql-backups
   2. Deploy via github repo
3. fly.io üëç - installs via cli, docs is pretty technical and scary - but it works - followed this article:
   * https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/node/
   * 120ms latency
   * deploy via cdn
4. render - [Only one free db and will be deleted after 90 days](https://render.com/docs/free#free-postgresql-databases)
   1. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-nodejs-application-with-render/
   2. have project on github
   3. create project type "Web Service" and connect to github
   4. create new postgres database (as opposed to heroku - the database is separate from the website)
   5. You'll need to add "npm i" to your package.json file, because 'render' doesn't automatically run npm i when you deploy.
   6. I needed to specify the node version to use, because render was using an old version of node (<15). To specify the node version, set an environment variable called "NODE_VERSION" and set it to the version you want:(16.13.1) in my case
   7. 105 latency
   8. As opposed to heroku, railway & fly.io - you'll need to manually set the DATABASE_URL environment variable for your postgres database.
   9. Positive:
      1. better management consule
      2. sends an email when the web site crashes - really wanted that in heroku
      3.
